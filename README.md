Tasks exploring different NLP concepts.

Programming Assignment #1:
This program focuses on creating feature vector files to train external machine learning systems.

Programming Assignment #2:
This program focuses on building a syntactic parser from scratch using the CKY parsing algorithm.

Programming Assignment #3:
This program focuses on implementing algorithms for word sense disambiguation, which assigns a sense to an occurrence  of a target word. 
Implemented two algorithms:  1)  the Lesk algorithm, and 2) a nearest neighbor method using distributional vectors.
